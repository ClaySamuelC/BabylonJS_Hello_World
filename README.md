# BabylonJS_Hello_World
This repo contains the basic building blocks of an app in BabylonJS.
The only dependency is babylonjs.
It simply displays a box in an open scene in the browser, the camera is free to rotate, strafe and zoom at will.

This repo will be used as a base-line for future babylon projects.
